## TODO List

- [ ] [Fix] Moving items in the inventory.
- [ ] [Add] Doodad destruction  
- [ ] [Add] Mining animation 
- [ ] [Add] Item database
- [ ] [Add] Chat window
- [ ] [Add] Drop item from inventory
- [ ] [Add] Pile of items model for multiple dropped items
- [ ] [Add] Pile of item container
- [ ] [Add] Take from Pile of item container
- [ ] [Add] Doodad decay (yes, including trees which will grow, die and spread naturally over time)

## Bugs to squash
- Sometimes when you move away from doodads while interacting the interaction animation persists.
- Water tiles below a certain height are using ["EMPTY"] tile type. Not sure why because water uses heights 0.0d to 0.05d
